# Bootstrap-B-B

This is for the Bootstrap B&B Assignment for CIS-130

Bootstrap is definitely trickier to implement, but it does really work well for making some cool and more uniform web page and for web page design.


NOTE: I reuploaded the submission after checking something to make sure a mistake would not occur and would be fixed. The mistake was an error in making a comment at the top of the CSS page made it so that the website design wouldn't register, so I fixed the mistake and deleted the files to make sure the corrected version was put up.
